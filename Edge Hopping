## Rate-Limit Bypass via Edge Hopping 

### Summary
An issue was discovered in Akamai Rate Controls in which attackers were able to bypass rate-limiting by distributing high-volume requests to different Akamai edge servers. Because the states of the rate thresholds were maintained locally within the edges, attackers are able to hit a target at high velocity that's well above the stipulated thresholds. 

### Description

A vulnerability was identified in Akamai's Rate Controls where the rate control states were maintained locally on their edges, allowing attackers to bypass rate-limiting by edge hopping - that is, rotating between different Akamai edge servers. 
This is because rate thresholds are counted per edge node (edge-specific) as opposed to an aggregated global state.  

### Disclosure
We have informed Akamai on 24 October 2024 and requested for global aggregation. Akamai acknowledged and shared that it is a known gap. A fix has since been released to Akamai's customers and is currently in beta mode. The release notes can be viewed here (requires login; only for Akamai customers):
